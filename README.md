# Project Introduction:
Carry out a series of data mining and data analysis through CRISP-DM and KDD processes. The project aims to predict high-rating applications for application development start-ups and provide decision support for application development direction. The IBM Software Analytics Solution folder contains one AppleStore.csv initial dataset file, eight stream files following CRISP-DM steps, and one ISAS.cpj SPSS Modeler process file of the project. The Open Source Analytics Solution folder contains three .csv dataset files, three .twb Tableau visualization files, five Weka data model files and one OSAS.py python code file of the project. The Big Data Analytics Solution folder contains two .csv dataset files, one .twb Tableau visualization file and two .ipynb jupyter notebook code files of the front half and the latter half of the project.

# Main Process:
1. Get the Apple Store dataset from the third-party open source website Kaggle
2. Use SPSS Modeler, Python, PySpark to understand and prepare data, including data exploration, data cleaning, data balancing, etc.
3. Discuss data mining methods, analyze and select appropriate data mining algorithms and models
4. Use SPSS Modeler, Sklearn, Weka, Spark ML to build data model, use SPSS Modeler, Tableau, Matplotlib to visualize the results
5. Use research skills and critical thinking to write reports, show the data mining process and visualization results, and make critical analysis and suggestions
