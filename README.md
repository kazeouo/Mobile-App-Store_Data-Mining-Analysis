# Project Introduction:
Carry out a series of data mining and data analysis through CRISP-DM and KDD processes. The project aims to predict high rating applications for application development start-ups and provide decision support for application development direction. The project contains three folders:

--The IBM Software Analytics Solution folder contains 1 AppleStore.csv initial dataset file, 8 SPSS Modeler stream files following CRISP-DM steps, and 1 ISAS.cpj SPSS Modeler process file
--The Open Source Analytics Solution folder contains 3 .csv dataset files, 3 .twb Tableau visualization files, 5 Weka data model files and 1 OSAS.py Python code file 
--The Big Data Analytics Solution folder contains 2 .csv dataset files, 1 .twb Tableau visualization file, and 2 .ipynb PySpark jupyter notebook code files.

# Main Process:
1. Get the Apple Store dataset from the third-party open source website Kaggle, determine the business objectives and data mining objectives of the project
2. Use SPSS Modeler, Python, PySpark to understand and prepare data, including data exploration, data cleaning, data balancing, etc.
3. Discuss data mining methods, analyze and select appropriate data mining algorithms and models of the project
4. Use SPSS Modeler, Sklearn, Weka, Spark ML to build data model, use SPSS Modeler, Tableau, Matplotlib to visualize the results
5. Use research skills and critical thinking to write reports, show the data mining process and visualization results, and make critical analysis and suggestions
