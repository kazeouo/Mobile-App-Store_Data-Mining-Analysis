Project Introduction:
Carry out a series of data mining and data analysis through CRISP-DM and KDD processes. The project aims to predict high-rating applications for application development start-ups and provide decision support for application development direction.

Main Process:
1. Get the Apple Store dataset from the third-party open source website Kaggle
2. Use SPSS Modeler, Python, PySpark to understand and prepare data, including data exploration, data cleaning, data balancing, etc.
3. Discuss data mining methods, analyze and select appropriate data mining algorithms and models
4. Use SPSS Modeler, Sklearn, Weka, Spark ML to build data model, use SPSS Modeler, Tableau, Matplotlib to visualize the results
5. Use research skills and critical thinking to write reports, show the data mining process and visualization results, and make critical analysis and suggestions
